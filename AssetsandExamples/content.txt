SECTION 2: WHAT MAKES PROPER DIFFERENT
Headline:
Not Just a Better Haircut. A Better Standard.

Body:
We didn't start Proper Barber Club to fix the barbershop.
We started it to respect your time, your routine, and your standards.

Here is our reason for being:

Membership-Only Access
No walk-ins. No chaos. Just consistent service by the same team, on your schedule.

Exceptional Barbers, Not Just Available Ones
Every member is matched with top-tier barbers who know their preferences and take pride in their craft.

Proprietary Technology
Scheduling, preferences, payments, and reminders are handled quietly in the background so your focus
stays on the experience.

A Calmer Space, Built for Men Who Know What They Want
No loud music. No crowded waiting areas. Just a clean, elevated space designed around you.

Exclusive Member-Only Events
Membership at Proper Barber Club includes more than grooming. From time to time, we host small,
invitation-only gatherings for members. These may include premium tastings, brand introductions, or quiet
evenings with thoughtful conversation. Events are optional, but designed to connect like-minded
individuals who value quality, have respect for their own time, and most importantly good company.
